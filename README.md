### customized template based off sam so i can get up and running quick exactly how i want it
### this does all the sam shit plus creates a table with a lambda function that sends an email and updates a record on the table on insert and i think some other stuff idk i don't remember
### also usable with amplify hosting/publishing/whatever

readme's for backend and client are in each dir, don't forget to do ctrl shft f on any replace_ occurrences
