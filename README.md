customized template based off sam so i can get up and running quick exactly how i want it

this does all the sam shit plus creates a table with a lambda function that sends an email and updates a record on the table on insert and i think some other stuff idk i don't remember

readme's for backend and client are in each dir, don't forget to do ctrl shft f on any replace_ occurrences

also usable with amplify hosting/publishing/whatever

### this may or may not work properly, i haven't tested it yet so idk. use at your own risk



# THANKS TO THE SAM CLI TEAM FOR SUCH A KICKASS STARTER!!!!
